# Data-intergrity-surveillance


****OVERVIEW****



Data integrity surveillance is a critical aspect of maintaining the reliability and 
trustworthiness of data within an organization or system. It involves the continuous 
monitoring, validation, and protection of data to ensure its accuracy, consistency, and 
reliability. In the realm of cybersecurity, data integrity surveillance focuses on detecting 
and preventing unauthorized alterations, deletions, or corruption of data. This involves 
implementing various techniques and technologies such as checksums, digital 
signatures, and encryption to verify the integrity of data and detect any unauthorized 
changes.

****SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS****



This includes database management systems (DBMS) or big data platforms like Hadoop or Spark, which offer scalable 
storage and processing capabilities. Additionally, specialized software for data integrity 
monitoring and analysis is essential, encompassing features such as real-time data 
monitoring, anomaly detection, and pattern recognition algorithms. Advanced encryption 
and cryptographic software ensure data security during transmission and storage, 
safeguarding against unauthorized access or tampering.
